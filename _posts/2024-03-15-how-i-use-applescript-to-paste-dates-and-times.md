In my day-to-day tasks I write the date and time a lot.

I've been a happy [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) user for years. In Rocket Pro, I created custom snippets using the [built-in variables](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/help.html#snippet-variables) to insert the date (e.g., 2024-03-15) or the date and time (e.g., 2024-03-15 04:00:00) in whatever I'm working on.

For writing the date generally, this works great. However, I also date and time stamp files and manually edit the output to a more friendly convention for filesystems. When I write on this blog I manually edit the date and time to a [format that Jekyll expects](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/#predefined-variables-for-posts) when posting. This manual step is enough to break my flow. I'd rather just insert what I need and move on.

I looked into how I can insert the date as `YYYY-MM-DD_HHMM` for files and as `YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS +/-TTTT` for Jekyll blog posts.

Rocket doesn't have a more granular date and time segments. macOS Text Replacements doesn't allow for variables. BetterTouchTool, KeyboardÂ Maestro, and TextExpander would all work but seem overpowered for my current text replacement needs. I do fine with macOS Text Replacements and Rocket (other than these more specific date and time use cases).

I decided on AppleScript and [FastScripts](https://redsweater.com/fastscripts/) for my solution. I use AppleScript enough to keep the Script menu in my menu bar. At a glance AppleScript seems to give me the level of granularity in a date and time that I want. I've used the trial of FastScripts before and enjoyed it, and using a FastScript keyboard shortcut allows me to quickly insert the date and time without breaking my concentration. I can also see myself using FastScripts more in the future.

Here are my AppleScripts.

The scripts are also available as GitHub Gists:

- [Paste Date.scpt](https://gist.github.com/ajnx/c3967ad0a43ee392615f81278da5c5ad)
- [Paste Date and Time for Files.scpt](https://gist.github.com/ajnx/b5b331d6b5a5e9403651335cfefba228)
- [Paste Date and Time for Jekyll.scpt](https://gist.github.com/ajnx/00022876d1ef4d43d1782f0200390737)

I've been using these for about a week now and it's been pretty slick. It's faster than typing the formatted date out by hand. It speeds up what I'm working on and keeps my brain in a flow state. They've been useful to me already and hopefully they're useful to you too.
